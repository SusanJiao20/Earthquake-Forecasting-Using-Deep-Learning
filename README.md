Earthquake forecasting based on time-series analysis of seismic wave is one of the most challenging problems for a variety of learning methodologies. In this project, we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the time until the next earthquake using laboratory data from the los Alamos National Laboratory. We evaluate and compare a number of variants of RNN based on LSTM and GRU. Both bidirectional and unidirectional architectures were employed to make forecasts. Unidirectional LSTM demonstrated the highest forecasting performance.
